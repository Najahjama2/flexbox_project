# flexbox_project

For this project the goal was to create a landing page to familiar myself with the usage of flexbox , there definitely things I could do to improve and change it but those are minimal style features such as making the logo , words instead of an image , changing my images to better looking ones etc
Both the HTML and CSS could do with sleeker grouping of the syntax but as this only my second project , I left these instact so that I can look back on how much I've improved. I also didn't want to get bogged down in the minute details..yet.
